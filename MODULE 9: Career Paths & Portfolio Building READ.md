## **📁 Building a Technical Writing Portfolio**

A great portfolio is your golden ticket into the world of technical writing. It's the first thing potential employers and clients will look at, and it should reflect your expertise, versatility, and unique writing voice.

### 🎯 **Why You Need a Portfolio**
- Demonstrates your writing and editing skills
- Shows familiarity with industry tools (Markdown, Git, static site generators)
- Builds credibility and trust
- Serves as a reference point during interviews

### 🧰 **What to Include in Your Portfolio**
- Product documentation (e.g., user guides, API docs)
- Tutorials or how-to guides
- Knowledge base articles
- UI microcopy examples
- SOPs or internal technical docs
- CLI or SDK documentation samples

**Pro Tip:** Focus on **quality over quantity.** It’s better to have 3-5 well-polished examples than 10 generic ones.

### 🗂️ **Where to Host Your Portfolio**
- **GitHub Pages** (Docs-as-code style portfolios)
- **Notion** or **Super.so** (quick and stylish)
- **Personal website** (custom domain shows professionalism)
- **Dev.to**, **Hashnode**, or **Medium** (for blogging-style samples)
